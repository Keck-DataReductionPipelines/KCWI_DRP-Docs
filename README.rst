Documentation for the KCWI Data Reduction Pipeline
==================================================

This is the documentation for the official
`DRP for the Keck Cosmic Web Imager <https://github.com/Keck-DataReductionPipeline/KCWI_DRP>`_ at the W. M.
Keck Observatory. It is built on the 
`KeckDRPFramework <https://github.com/Keck-DataReductionPipelines/KeckDRPFramework>`_,
and is a port of the old 
`IDL pipeline <https://github.com/Keck-DataReductionPipelines/KcwiDRP>`_.

The pipeline has only been thoroughly tested on MacOS, Ubuntu, and CentOS, although it
should run smoothly on any unix-like system that runs Python. Unfortunately, Windows 
is not currently supported.
